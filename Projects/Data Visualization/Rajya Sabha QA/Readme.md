Project abstract:
India is the largest democracy in the world and has a bicameral legislature consisting of an upper house called ‘Rajya Sabha’ which represent the states of the Indian federation and the lower house called ‘Lok Sabha’ which represent the people of India as whole. [1] These two houses are the heart of Indian legislature and all decisions pertaining to the present and future of India are made here. During its regular working sessions, each house discusses and debates on a variety of topics – some trivial while some are of critical national importance. At the start of each session, there is a questions hour where members can ask questions to cabinet ministers on topics related to national interest. Analyzing these questions and their answers can help extract key themes that shaped the country over the past few years.
